# Tellit
‘Tellit’ presents a solo project that aims to connect movie producers, content creators, and more with a diverse array of stories for use in films, skits, and other creative projects.

This app offers a win-win scenario, facilitating writers in earning recognition and revenue while offering content creators and filmmakers a hassle-free avenue to source compelling stories. 💰📝
As earlier stated, it’s a solo project, and it was a great and exhilarating ride working on this, but in future versions, I hope to take on team members so we could together take the writing community by storm!
Here is the story behind how I came up with Tellit
If you believe I created this because of my love for writing, you’re mistaken 😂. I have a confession to make.😱Writing is not something I particularly enjoy; I find it exhausting. 😅 So, why then did I dedicate this entire project to writers?

It all goes back to my younger sister, who is a writer extraordinaire. ✍️🌺 I’d venture to say she was born with a pen in her hand. 🖊️👶 Whenever I lacked the motivation to put words on the page, she would weave her magic with her pen and come to my rescue.
I’ve witnessed her evolution from a budding writer to someone who can not only assist her older brother but also captivate readers worldwide. 🌍
This personal journey has left a lasting impact on me, prompting me to embark on this endeavor. Writing may tire me out, but coding ignites my passion.
Thus, the idea struck me — why not craft codes to support individuals like her in their writing pursuits? ☺️✨Why not WRITE codes to help people like her WRITE? 🤷‍♂️📝
